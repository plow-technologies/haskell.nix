# `overlay` to `extras`

`overlay` was renamed to `extras` in #79 to prevent confusion between the notion of nix overlays.
Therefore `plan-pkgs` and `stack-pkgs` as generated by `plan-to-nix` and `stack-to-nix` will
expose `extras` instead of `overlay`. Similarly `mkStackPkgSet`, `mkPkgSet` and `mkCabalProjectPkgSet`
take a `pkg-def-extras` instead of `pkg-def-overlay` argument.  If you are using `iohk-nix`, the
`iohk-overlay` was parameter was renamed to `iohk-extras`.

# Drop `th-packages`

When using `iohk-nix` to facility cross compilation, we used to require explicit listing of packages
that required `TemplateHaskell`, this was dropped in [iohk-nix@da7c1ed](https://github.com/input-output-hk/iohk-nix/commit/da7c1edc31d24ff4a211b7dc2361c71af7c3bda4), see #92.
As such the `th-packages` and `nixpkgs` argument were dropped from the `iohk-module`.
